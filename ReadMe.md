### Introduction
> Greetings, so the thing that I want to have at the first place is to have some music from youtube into my device, that's why, I created this program.
You just need first to contact `BotFather` on telegram, and get the Token for your bot. Then look for the [ENV](#env) for the sample configuration.

### Packages
1. Nodemon
```Bash
npm install nodemon
```

2. Node Telegram Bot API
```Bash
npm install node-telegram-bot-api
```

3. Youtubei.js
```Bash
npm install youtubei.js
```

4. Filesystem
```Bash
npm install fs
```

### ENV
> Here's the sample configuration for `.env` file
```.env
TOKEN=SAMPLETOKEN:FROMBOTFATHER
```

### Notes
> This program is intended just to save music into your devices, the program was free thou, so if you want to host it, you may look for some web hosting
online related to nodejs. You may also install all the packages once you clone this project using `npm install` and it will automatically install all
required programs. For more concerns, kindly give us feedback on [facebook](https://facebook.com/MPOP.ph) or join to our [TELEGRAM GROUP](https://t.me/amogusmusicfeed).
