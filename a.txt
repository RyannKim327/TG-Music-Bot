-i-
A fragrance of flower, in a sunny morning
Taking photos for someone, for a something
Saying nothing, just to lie in
My heart was singing, banging your name in

-ii-
Lying on the grass, taking all the past
Saying how life goes, and life runs fast
And telling to myself, now at last
I can tell to you, why I urge and rush

-iii-
The memories on my device, making my eyes cried
From that single moment, that makes myself hurt
Asking and telling why, why do I need to take this?
Why do I need to do such thing, that I can't resist?

-iv-
Mom said: everything gonna be okay
Time may past, and nothing happens
That moment of mine, that I hope may
The hope, that will remain the same

-v-
I don;
